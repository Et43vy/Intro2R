# Introduction

Suppose we have a paired data set then we can test the NULL hypothesis 

$$
H_0 : \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0
$$

Using `t.test(x,y,mu = 0, paired = TRUE)`

Note that the order of the data matters, in the above `t.test` `mu=0` means $\mu_x - \mu_y=0$ whereas `t.test(y,x,mu = 0, paired = TRUE)`, `mu=0` means $\mu_y -\mu_x = 0$. 

The NULL hypothesis could be expressed differently depending on the experiment and prior information eg: $\mu_x - \mu_y = 10$ rather than 0. 

# Where does a paired sample come from?

Paired data are very common. Whenever multivariate data is measured pairs will be formed.
