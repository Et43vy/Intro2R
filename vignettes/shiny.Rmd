# Introduction

The shiny server allows the data scientist to take an otherwise static application and make it dynamic. This is done through the use of a concept called "reactivity".

In this document we will begin from the basic structure of the server application and then introduce the detail of the parts which make the rogramming easy.

This is "magic" with some plans and rules.
